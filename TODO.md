## Needs to be done
* Clean up events, it's kind of wierd at the moment
* Better structure for generating bait and level controller
* Snake into it's own class, takes up too much of level
* Change drawing from center to back to left top corner
* Reduce movespeed (reset interval) on bait hit
* Make sure bait does not appear out of the game area
* Snake hit detection
* Running out of the window makes the snake appear from the other side

## Is done

* Canvas size independent from resolution (1920*1080), always in proportion
